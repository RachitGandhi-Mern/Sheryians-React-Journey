## 📘 About This Repository

This repo documents my complete **React learning journey**!  
I learned React through **Dhanesh Malviya Sir’s** amazing course — **MernStack-Cohort** — and have created detailed notes in my own way to make concepts crystal clear.

### 📁 Folder Structure

Each day/topic has its own folder with:

- `📝 my-version-notes.yaml` → My personal version of the notes  
- `📚 notes.md` → Combined version with **ChatGPT + my notes**, explained in more detail

You can refer to whichever format suits you best!

## 🌈 For the Best Experience

I strongly recommend using the following **VS Code extension** to view the notes clearly:

> 🔌 **Better Comments** by Aaron Bond

I've used it throughout the notes to:
- ✅ Highlight key concepts
- 💡 Mark helpful tips
- ⚠️ Show important warnings
- ❗ Emphasize critical points

Thanks again for visiting this repo! 😊  
Happy Coding! 🚀
